Changes made in EUMETCastView v1.1.6 :

- Decoding and display of OLCI EFR and ERR images from the Sentinel-3A.

**How to use the 'False Color' button**

Displaying the 'Brightness Temperture' in a projection image is only possible for the bands M12 to M16 for VIIRS images. If a monochrome projection image is displayed, the button "False Color" in the 'Projections' tab of the Toolbox will change the monochrome image to a color image according to a colormap. In the 'Preferences - Projection' dialog box there are 4 different colormaps to choose from.

When the false color image is first displayed the maximum and minimum temperature establishes the boundaries of the colors displayed.
