title: New release v1.0.6
---

The following changes were made:
- The program will start with the last  selection made for VIIRS and geostationary images.
- The processing of the VIIRS images runs in a worker thread.
- For the smoothing of the VIIRS images a bilinear interpolation algorithm was used.

For using the new smoothing algo you need to set the radio button in Preferences - Image properties - 'Bilinear interpolation'.
