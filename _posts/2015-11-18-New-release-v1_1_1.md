title: New release v1.1.1
---

The following features were added in v1.1.1 :

- Decoding of VIIRS DNB images with geolocation.
- Bilinear interpolation for GAC and Noaa. The interpolation works now for VIIRS (DNB and M band), Metop, GAC and Noaa.
- Points of interest database (POI).

In the projection tab there is now a combobox with a collection of POI's for the three different projections. Only a few POI's examples are included when you first start up the program. The button "Add POI" allows you to create a collection of coordinates yourself for the different projections. The POI's are saved in the file 'POI.ini'.
In 'Preferences' - 'Projection' you can view (and update) the database you created.

This release also include the decoding of DNB files. The geolocation data allows you to project the image to LCC, GVP or SG.
