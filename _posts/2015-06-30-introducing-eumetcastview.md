title: Introducing EUMETCastView
---

After quite a few years of developing this software I finally decided to publish it as Open Software. The software has evolved from a satellite prediction program to a viewer for AVHRR, VIIRS and HRIT/LRIT images.

Originally it was an exercise in Qt 3.0, but as the program progressed I included an OpenGL globe, XRIT and AVHRR imagery decoding software and finally, when the data from the SUOMI-NPP came available in EUMETCast, I included also VIIRS imagery decoding. The current version uses Qt 5.5.

> This kind of software is of course never finished, and I intend to extend it with new features.
