By selecting 'Texture On' in the Toolbox you can, when rendering an image, also render to the 3D Globe texture. The 3D Globe texture is an Equirectangular projection, more specific a 'plate carr√©e projection'. By clicking on the button 'Save texture' in the bottom toolbar you can save a copy if this texture to disk. This file will be saved in the directory where the program resides. The format is 'textureYYYYMMDDHHMM.jpg'.

The dimensions of this saved texture is the same as the input texture.
